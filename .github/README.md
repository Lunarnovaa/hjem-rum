A module collection for managing your `$HOME` with [Hjem].

## A brief explanation

> [!WARNING]
> Hjem Rum is currently considered alpha softwareâ€•here be dragons. While many of
> us currently use its modules in our NixOS configurations, that does not mean
> it will necessarily offer a seamless experience yet, nor does it mean there
> will not be breaking changes (there will). As Hjem Rum continues to grow and
> evolve, it should become more stable and expansive, but please be patient as
> it is a hobby project. Furthermore, Hjem, the tooling Hjem Rum is built off
> of, is still unfinished and missing critical features, such as services. Hjem
> Rum is still useable, but it is not for the novice user.

Built off the Hjem tooling, Hjem Rum (loosely translated to "rooms of a home")
is a collection of modules for various applications intended to simplify `$HOME`
management for usage and configuration of applications.

Hjem was initially created as a streamlined implementation of the `home`
functionality that Home Manager provides. Hjem Rum, in contrast, is intended to
provide an expansive module collection as a useful abstraction for users to
configure their applications with ease, recreating Home Manager's complete
functionality.

## Usage and Documentation

Hjem Rum includes a full set of documentation, including an options search
system. Please see our [documentation] for both guides on installing Hjem Rum
and a full list of options that you can configure programs with.
